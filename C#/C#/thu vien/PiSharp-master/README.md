# PiSharp
Raspberry Pi GPIO Library for .NET

Pi# (pronounced “Pi Sharp”) is a library to expose the GPIO functionality of the Raspberry Pi computer to the C# and Visual Basic.Net languages.

Also included is the Pi# simulator which runs under Windows, OSX or Linux to allow you to develop and test GPIO based programs without a Raspberry Pi. For information on using Pi# see [Setting Up Pi Sharp](https://github.com/andycb/PiSharp/wiki/Setting-Up-Pi-Sharp)
