======================================================================[2014-01-02]
Version 1.2.0 - New platform release (fully compatible with 1.0.0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Apple Mac OSX support (Tested under OSX 10.9.1 Mavericks)
- UDOO Quad support
- Some bug fixed
- Documentation improved and updated.
==================================================================================

[Added]

- Apple OSX full support :
  makefiles, source examples, binary library and binary demos supplied.
  new osx folders added in the entire project. 

- UDOO Quad (Linux board Freescale i.MX 6 Quad based) full support.
  Added /release/Linux/ARMHF/Udoo folder with libsnap7.so compiled under 
  Ubuntu 12.10.

[fixed]

- S7API directive missing for two functions in snap7_libmain.h
  (Thanks to Mathias Küsel for reporting)

- fixed Snap7.S7Server.Srv_RegisterArea in snap7.net.cs
  (Thanks to André for reporting).

- Added a static var to contain the callback addresses into c# examples.
  The .net garbage collector *sometime* garbages the delegates (called by unmanaged
  code) if their address is not stored into a static var.
  MS says that it's not a clr bug (maybe a feature ????)
  However this solves the problem.
  PLEASE SEE THE .NET EXAMPLES IF YOU PLAN TO USE SNAP7 (or other unmanaged)
  CALLBACKS.
  (Thanks to Martin Bratt for reporting).

- Srv_SetReadEventsCallback prototype missing in Snap7.pas
